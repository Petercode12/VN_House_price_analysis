# VN house price analysis
This project is a task that is assigned to our team by Mr.Tam in my university. The dataset is surveyed mainly about real estate situation in Viet Nam, including 47 columns of features and 19137 entries. Our job is to have an analysis on these data and also build a model to predict house price in a certain area.
